# Requires:
- Terraform 0.12
- Permissions on the IAM user to be able to create policies and roles

# Required variables to set or update

#### account_id
Target account id. Where will DivvyCloud be deployed?  
account_id = "013456789123"  

#### region
What region will the install be rolled out in?  
region = "us-west-2"  
  
#### az
3 AZs for redundancy (ALL 3 ARE REQUIRED)  
az = ["us-west-2a","us-west-2b","us-west-2c"]  

#### egress_whitelist
Where should outbound access be allowed from (does not apply to IGW)  
egress_whitelist = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  

#### ingress_whitelist
Where should access to the UI be exposed to?  
ingress_whitelist = ["1.2.3.4/32", "73.169.50.3/32"]  

#### lb_port
Accepted values: 80 and 443  
If 443 is set, a certificate needs to be supplied as well  
lb_port = 80

#### alb_ssl_cert_name
If setting 443 the name of the ACM cert that will be attached needs to be supplied. Note: Just the name, not the full ARN  
alb_ssl_cert_name = "YOUR-ACM-SSL-CERT-ID-HERE"  


# Troubleshooting
- Go to the DivvyCloud-ECS cluster  
- Look to see if the tasks are running  
- If not, go to the logs for the DELETE-ME task and look for the "Stopped" logs  
- If there's nothing there, go to the Tasks tab, click on a task (stopped), and expand the details ">" at the bottom. The logs there should help.  

# Teardown
- RDS has deletion protection on and will need to have that manually turned off before destroying. 
- The NAT GW can't be deleted if RDS is still around as it'll have IPs associated  


# Notes
 - The divvykeys_task is a one-time run to create the divvykeys database (this is temporary and weâ€™re working on a better mechanism). Once the rest of the services/tasks are working, you can delete the DELETE-ME-AFTER-FIRST-RUN service.  
 - For scaling the other services, you can adjust the task variables up after deployment.
